## Project Overview
These are the scripts for my game, **Whirl**, a puzzle game made in the 2D Unity game engine.
This repository contains all of the scripts that control the game, from player control to dialogue.

## Game Idea
**Whirl** is a physics based puzzle platformer about rotation and you have to rotate the level in order to complete the puzzle. By rotating the level you change the relative direction of down (since gravity stays the same) and unlock ways to solve the level. It also changes how moving objects are moving relative to other objects in the game, allowing for fun and interesting possibilities for puzzle solving.

## Features
- A playercontroller that handles movement on tilted walls
- A script that automatically rotates the entire level and everything in it in a continuous manner
- All the basic puzzle triggers like doors, buttons, turrets, and lasers, etc.

## Controls
- Press **Q** or **E** to rotate the world counterclockwise and clockwise respectively.
- Gravity shifts automatically with the rotation.
- Use **A/D** to move the player, and **W** to jump.
- Interact with puzzle objects using **Left Click**.
